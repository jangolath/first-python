## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This is a personal project to re-learn Python after a ~20-year hiatus. The primary goal is to build a **basic REST API** using modern Python (version 3.13) and explore what's changed in the language and ecosystem since the early 2000s. In addition to foundational Python learning, this project also aims to explore **integration with AI systems**.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

- Reacquaint with Python syntax, idioms, and modern libraries.
- Understand changes from Python 2.x era to Python 3.13.
- Gain hands-on experience with building APIs using Python.
- Experiment with basic AI integrations (e.g., calling a model, processing responses).
- Serve as a personal sandbox for development and experimentation.

## ðŸš€ Technologies

- **Python 3.13**
- **FastAPI** (planned) â€“ lightweight and modern web framework
- **Uvicorn** â€“ ASGI server for running FastAPI apps
- **HTTP-based REST API** principles
- [Optional] **AI APIs** or libraries (TBD)

## ðŸ“¦ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jangolath/first-python.git
